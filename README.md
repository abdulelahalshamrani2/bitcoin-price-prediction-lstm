# Bitcoin Price Prediction using LSTM

## Overview
This project uses the LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) algorithm to analyze the impact of Bitcoin on the banking and finance sectors. Historical Bitcoin price and trading data from Kaggle were used to train a predictive model capable of forecasting future Bitcoin prices and anticipating price fluctuations.

The LSTM algorithm, a type of deep neural network designed for time-series data, helps capture long-term dependencies in historical data. The model is implemented in Python using TensorFlow.

## Aim
To predict Bitcoin price trends and evaluate their potential effects on the financial and banking sectors using machine learning.

## Dataset
Historical Bitcoin price and trading data from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/).

## Dependencies
The project requires the following Python libraries:
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- plotly
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
- tensorflow

You can also install them directly via:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib plotly seaborn scikit-learn tensorflow
